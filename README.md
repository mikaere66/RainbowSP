Welcome to the **Rainbows** app, designed by an Xperia SP fan just as a bit of fun, and to share with other Sony Xperia fans.

Firstly, and most importantly, **this app requires root access**. If your phone is not rooted, then this app will simply do nothing!

Secondly, it was designed to **run only on the Sony Xperia SP**. Although there are *other* models that support lighting effects, like the Xperia U, they have a very different way of turning those lights on and off! Again, if your phone is *not* a Sony Xperia SP, then this app will simply do nothing!

**How it works**:

The rainbow and dance sequences are based on a bash script originally [shared on XDA-Developers forum by nixx-X1](https://tinyurl.com/XDA-Developers){:target="_blank"} way back in 2013.

Basically, the individual commands from that script are stored here in a database, then called upon in a variety of ways, depending on the chosen effect.
